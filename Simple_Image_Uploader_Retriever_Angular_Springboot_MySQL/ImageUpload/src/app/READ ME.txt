need to import HttpClientModule and HttpFormsModule on app.module.ts

we use FormData() function on uploading the file

FormData Methods
    append(name, value) 
    – add a form field with the given name and value , formData. 
    append(name, blob, fileName)
    – add a field as if it were <input type="file"> , the 
      third argument fileName sets file name (not form field name), 
      as it were a name of the file in user's filesystem, formData

working for any type of image 
  (tested on jpeg, jpg, png, .webp & jfif)
